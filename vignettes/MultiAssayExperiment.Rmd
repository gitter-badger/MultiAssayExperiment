# Overview of the `MultiAssayExperiment` class

Here is an overview of the class and its constructors and extractors:
```{r}
empty <- MultiAssayExperiment()
empty
slotNames(empty)
class(Elist(empty))       #Elist
class(pData(empty)) #DataFrame
class(sampleMap(empty))   #DataFrame
class(metadata(empty))    #NULL (class "ANY")
methods(class="MultiAssayExperiment")
```

Subsetting of samples and features is harmonized through some generic
functions:

```{r}
methods("rownames") # features
methods("colnames") # samples
```

# pData: primary Data
The `MultiAssayExperiment` keeps one set of "primary" metadata that describes 
the biological specimens, and is overarching of all the individual multi-omics 
assays.  The user can create this as a `data.frame` or a `DataFrame`; in either 
case it is stored internally as a `DataFrame`.  

In the following examples we will have assays for 4 patients, with the
following bit of metadata relating to the patients:

```{r}
masPheno <- data.frame(sex=c("M", "F", "M", "F"),
    age=38:41,
    row.names=c("Jack", "Jill", "Bob", "Barbara"))
masPheno
```

# A simple example where sampleMap isn't provided

If each assay uses the same colnames (ie, if the same sample identifiers are 
used for each experiment), a simple list of these datasets is sufficient for 
the `MultiAssayExperiment()` constructor function.  It is not necessary for 
them to have the same rownames or colnames:
```{r}
exprss1 <- matrix(rnorm(16), ncol = 4,
        dimnames = list(sprintf("ENST00000%i", sample(288754:290000, 4)),
                c("Jack", "Jill", "Bob", "Bobby")))
exprss2 <- matrix(rnorm(12), ncol = 3, 
        dimnames = list(sprintf("ENST00000%i", sample(288754:290000, 4)),
                c("Jack", "Jane", "Bob")))
doubleExp <- list("methyl 2k"  = exprss1, "methyl 3k" = exprss2)
simpleMultiAssay <- MultiAssayExperiment(Elist=doubleExp)
simpleMultiAssay
```

In the above example, the user did not provide the `pData` argument so the 
constructor function filled it with a trivial DataFrame:
```{r}
pData(simpleMultiAssay)
```

But the `pData` can be provided.  Here, note that any assay sample (column) that 
cannot be mapped to a corresponding row in the provided `pData` gets dropped.  
This is part of ensuring internal validity of the `MultiAssayExperiment`.
```{r}
simpleMultiAssay2 <- MultiAssayExperiment(Elist=doubleExp, pData=masPheno)
simpleMultiAssay2
pData(simpleMultiAssay2)
```

# Creating a `MultiAssayExperiment` object: a rich example

In this section we demonstrate all core supported data classes, using different
sample ID conventions for each assay, with master pData. The currently supported
classes of datasets are `matrix`, `ExpressionSet`, `RangedSummarizedExperiment`,
and `RangedRaggedAssay`. 

## Create toy datasets demonstrating all supported data types
We have three matrix-like datasets.  First let's say expression data,
which in this example we represent as an `ExpressionSet`:

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(Biobase)
(arraydat <- matrix(seq(101, 108), ncol=4,
                    dimnames=list(c("ENST00000294241", "ENST00000355076"),
                                  c("array1", "array2", "array3", "array4"))))
arraypdat <- as(data.frame(slope53=rnorm(4),
                           row.names=c("array1", "array2", "array3",
                                       "array4")), "AnnotatedDataFrame")
exprdat <- ExpressionSet(assayData=arraydat, phenoData=arraypdat)
exprdat
```

The following map matches pData sample names to exprdata sample
names.  Note that row orders aren't initially matched up, and this is OK.

```{r}
(exprmap <- data.frame(master=rownames(masPheno)[c(1, 2, 4, 3)],
                       assay=c("array1", "array2", "array3", "array4"),
                       stringsAsFactors = FALSE))
```

Now methylation data, which we will represent as a `matrix`.  It uses 
gene identifiers also, but measures a partially overlapping set of genes.  
For fun, let's store this as a simple matrix. Also, it contains a replicate 
for one of the patients.

```{r}
(methyldat <-
   matrix(1:10, ncol=5, 
          dimnames=list(c("ENST00000355076", "ENST00000383706"),
                        c("methyl1", "methyl2", "methyl3",
                          "methyl4", "methyl5"))))
```

The following map matches pData sample names to methyldat sample
names.

```{r}
(methylmap <- data.frame(master = c("Jack", "Jack", "Jill", "Barbara", "Bob"),
              assay = c("methyl1", "methyl2", "methyl3", "methyl4", "methyl5"),
              stringsAsFactors = FALSE))
```

Now we have a microRNA platform, which has no common identifiers with the
other datasets, and which we also represent as a `matrix`.  It
is also missing data for Jill.  Just for fun, let's use the same
sample naming convention as we did for arrays.

```{r}
(microdat <- matrix(201:212, ncol=3, 
                    dimnames=list(c("hsa-miR-21", "hsa-miR-191",
                                    "hsa-miR-148a", "hsa-miR148b"), 
                                  c("micro1", "micro2", "micro3"))))
```

And the following map matches pData sample names to microdat
sample names.

```{r}
(micromap <- data.frame(master = c("Jack", "Barbara", "Bob"),
                        assay = c("micro1", "micro2", "micro3"),
                        stringsAsFactors = FALSE))
```

Let's include a `RangedRaggedAssay`, which is defined in this package and
extends `GRangesList`.  This is intended for data such as segmented copy
number, which provide genomic ranges that may be different for each sample.
We start with a `GRangesList`, which will later be converted automatically
by the `MultiAssayExperiment` constructor function.

```{r}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(GenomicRanges))
## completely encompasses ENST00000355076
gr1 <-
  GRanges(seqnames = "chr3", ranges = IRanges(58000000, 59502360),
          strand = "+", score = 5L, GC = 0.45)
## first is within ENST0000035076
gr2 <-
  GRanges(seqnames = c("chr3", "chr3"),
          ranges = IRanges(c(58493000, 3), width=9000),
          strand = c("+", "-"), score = 3:4, GC = c(0.3, 0.5))
gr3 <-
  GRanges(seqnames = c("chr1", "chr2"),
          ranges = IRanges(c(1, 4), c(3, 9)),
          strand = c("-", "-"), score = c(6L, 2L), GC = c(0.4, 0.1))
grl <- GRangesList("gr1" = gr1, "gr2" = gr2, "gr3" = gr3)
names(grl) <- c("snparray1", "snparray2", "snparray3")
grl
```

The following `data.frame` matches pData sample to the
`GRangesList`:

```{r}
(rangemap <- data.frame(master = c("Jack", "Jill", "Jill"),
                        assay = c("snparray1", "snparray2", "snparray3"),
                        stringsAsFactors = FALSE))
```

Finally, we create a dataset of class `RangedSummarizedExperiment`:

```{r}
library(SummarizedExperiment)
nrows <- 5; ncols <- 4
counts <- matrix(runif(nrows * ncols, 1, 1e4), nrows)
rowRanges <- GRanges(rep(c("chr1", "chr2"), c(2, nrows - 2)),
                     IRanges(floor(runif(nrows, 1e5, 1e6)), width=100),
                     strand=sample(c("+", "-"), nrows, TRUE),
                     feature_id=sprintf("ID\\%03d", 1:nrows))
names(rowRanges) <- letters[1:5]
colData <- DataFrame(Treatment=rep(c("ChIP", "Input"), 2),
                     row.names= c("mysnparray1", "mysnparray2",
                                  "mysnparray3", "mysnparray4"))
rse <- SummarizedExperiment(assays=SimpleList(counts=counts),
                            rowRanges=rowRanges, colData=colData)
```

```{r}
(rangemap2 <-
   data.frame(master = c("Jack", "Jill", "Bob", "Barbara"), 
              assay = c("mysnparray1", "mysnparray2", "mysnparray3",
                        "mysnparray4"), stringsAsFactors = FALSE))
```

## sampleMap
Because we used platform-specific sample identifiers (e.g. mysnparray1, etc), 
we must create an ID map for all available experiments.
The `MultiAssayExperiment` constructor function can do this automatically
if a single naming convention is used, bypassing this step. 
You must provide a three-column `data.frame` or `DataFrame`, 
with the following columns and exactly the specified column names:

1. **master** provides the "master" sample names.  All values in this column
must also be present in the rownames of pData(MultiAssayExperiment).
In this example, allowable values in this column are "Jack", "Jill",
"Barbara", and "Bob".

2. **assay** provides the sample names used by experimental datasets, which
in practice are often different than the master sample names.  For each assay,
every sample name must be found in this column: for example, every value
returned by colnames(exprdat) must be found among the rows containing `Affy`.
Otherwise, those assays would be orphaned: it would be impossible to match
them up to samples in the overall experiment. However, duplicated values are
allowed, to represent replicates with the same overall experiment-level
annotation.

3. **assayname** provides the names of the different experiments / assays
performed. These are user-defined, with the only requirement that the names
of the `Elist`, where the experimental assays are stored, must be contained
in this column. In this example we will use the following names:

```{r}
listmap <- list(exprmap, methylmap, micromap, rangemap, rangemap2)
names(listmap) <- c("Affy", "Methyl 450k", "Mirna", "CNV gistic", "CNV gistic2")
listmap
```

The following non-exported convenience function converts a list of `data.frame` 
objects to a valid object for the `sampleMap`:

```{r, message = FALSE}
dfmap <- listToMap(listmap)
dfmap
```

Note, `dfmap` can be reverted to a list with another provided function:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
mapToList(dfmap, "assayname")
```

## Experimental data as a `list()`
Create an named list of experiments for the MultiAssay function. All of these
names must be found within in the third column of `dfmap`:

```{r}
objlist <- list("Affy" = exprdat, "Methyl 450k" = methyldat,
                "Mirna" = microdat, "CNV gistic" = grl, "CNV gistic2" = rse)
```

## Creation of the `MultiAssayExperiment` class object

We recommend using the `MultiAssayExperiment()` constructor function:

```{r}
myMultiAssay <- MultiAssayExperiment(objlist, masPheno, dfmap)
myMultiAssay
```

The following extractor functions can be used to get extract data from
the object:

```{r}
Elist(myMultiAssay)
pData(myMultiAssay)
sampleMap(myMultiAssay)
metadata(myMultiAssay)
```

Note that the `Elist` class extends the `SimpleList` class to add some 
validity checks specific to `MultiAssayExperiment`.  It can be used like
a list.

# `RangedRaggedAssay` class

Note that the GRangesList got converted to a `RangedRaggedAssay`, a class 
intended for data such as segmented copy number that is provides different 
genomic ranges for each sample.  `RangedRaggedAssay` is defined by this 
package and inherits from `GRangesList`:

```{r}
methods(class="RangedRaggedAssay")
getMethod("colnames", "RangedRaggedAssay")
```

It has some additional methods that are required for any data class contained 
in a `MultiAssayExperiment`:
```{r}
class(Elist(myMultiAssay)[[4]])
rownames(Elist(myMultiAssay)[[4]])
colnames(Elist(myMultiAssay)[[4]])
assay(Elist(myMultiAssay)[[4]])
```

# Subsetting

The core functionality of `MultiAssayExperiment` is to allow subsetting by 
assay, rownames, and colnames, across all experiments simultaneously while 
guaranteeing continued matching of samples.

## Subsetting by sample / columns

Subsetting by column, i.e. columns, will be more obvious after recalling
the pData:

```{r}
pData(myMultiAssay)
```

Subsetting by samples acts on the pData DataFrame, and can be done using an
integer, a character vector containing rownames of pData, or logical.
For example using an integer to keep the first two rows of pData:

```{r}
subset(myMultiAssay, 1:2, "colnames")
```

Note that the above operation keeps different numbers of columns / samples
from each assay, reflecting the reality that some samples may not have been
assayed in all experiments, and may have replicates in some.
Another example using rownames and returning the same result:

```{r}
subset(myMultiAssay, c("Jack", "Jill"), "colnames")
```

And finally, an example using a logical:
```{r}
subset(myMultiAssay, pData(myMultiAssay)$sex=="M", "colnames")
```

## Subsetting by assays

You can select certain assays / experiments using subset, by providing a
character, logical, or integer vector.  An example using character:

```{r}
subset(myMultiAssay, c("Affy", "CNV gistic"), "assays")
```

Examples using logical and integer:
```{r}
is.cnv = grepl("CNV", names(Elist(myMultiAssay)))
is.cnv
subset(myMultiAssay, is.cnv, "assays")
subset(myMultiAssay, which(is.cnv), "assays")
```

`subset()` is an endogenous operation, in that it always returns another 
`MultiAssayExperiment` object. Use `assay(myMultiAssay)` to retrieve the 
experimental data in an ordinary `list` of datasets as their original classes.

## Subsetting by rownames / features IDs

Rownames (feature IDs) **must be specified as a character vector** - integer
and logical vectors do not make sense because in general assays may have
different identifiers. This operation always returns a `MultiAssayExperiment`
class, with any `Elist` element not containing the feature having zero rows.


Returns MultiAssayExperiment where `Affy` and `Methyl 450k` contain
only ENST0000035076 row, and "Mirna" and "CNV gistic" have zero rows:
(`drop` argument is set to `TRUE` by default)

```{r}
featSubsetted0 <- subset(myMultiAssay, "ENST00000355076", "rownames")
class(featSubsetted0)
class(Elist(featSubsetted0))
Elist(featSubsetted0)
```

In the following, `Affy` ExpressionSet keeps both rows but with their
order reversed, and `Methyl 450k` keeps only its second row.

```{r}
featSubsetted <-
  subset(myMultiAssay, c("ENST00000355076", "ENST00000294241"), "rownames")
exprs(Elist(myMultiAssay)[[1]])
exprs(Elist(featSubsetted)[[1]])
```

## Subsetting rows / feature by `GenomicRanges`

For `MultiAssayExperiment` objects containing range-based objects (currently 
`RangedSummarizedExperiment` and `RangedRaggedAssay`), these can be subset 
using a `GRanges` object, for example:
```{r}
gr <- GRanges(seqnames = c("chr1"), strand = c("-", "+", "-"), 
              ranges = IRanges(start = c(1, 4, 6), width = 3))
```

Now do the subsetting.  The function doing the work here is
`IRanges::subsetByOverlaps` - see its arguments for flexible types of
subsetting by range. The first three arguments here are for `subset`, the
rest passed on to `IRanges::subsetByOverlaps` through "...":

```{r}
subsetted <- subset(myMultiAssay, gr, "rownames", maxgap = 2L, type = "within")
Elist(subsetted)
```

# Bracket operations 

The bracket method for the `MultiAssayExperiment` returns a specified subset
of the data. The positions within the bracket operator, indicate `rownames`,
`colnames`, and `assays` respectively. 

Subset by rownames using the bracket `[` method (only character is allowed):

```{r}
myMultiAssay["ENST00000355076", , ]
```

By columns - character, integer, and logical are allowed:
```{r}
myMultiAssay[, "Jack", ]
myMultiAssay[, 1, ]
myMultiAssay[, c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE), ]
```

By assay - character, integer, and logical are allowed:
```{r}
myMultiAssay[, , "Mirna"]
myMultiAssay[, , 3]
myMultiAssay[, , c(FALSE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE)]
```



# Requirements for support of additional data classes

Any data classes in the Elist object must support the following methods:

* `colnames()`
* `rownames()`
* `assay()`    #to return experimental data
* `[`


Here is what happens if one of the methods doesn't:
```{r}
objlist2 <- objlist
objlist2[[2]] <- data.frame(objlist2[[2]])
invalid.obj <- try(MultiAssayExperiment(objlist2, masPheno, dfmap))
invalid.obj
```

# Wishlist

* `c()` function for adding new assays to existing `MultiAssayExperiment`
    + e.g. c(myMultiAssay, neweset)
    + require that sample names in the new object match pData sample names
    + require that sample names in the new object already exist in pData
* Figure out how to support a "long-and-skinny" SQL database
* "mergeDups" function to merge duplicate samples in any assay
    + For matrix-like objects, it is clear how to do this. Default would be
      simple mean of the columns, but could allow user-specified functions.
    + For GRangesList, it's not obvious how to merge duplicates.
      Just concatenate?
